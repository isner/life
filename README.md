# Life

A basic implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for the browser.

## Demo

See a working demo at [mattisner.com/life](http://mattisner.com/life).

## Instructions

The starting cells are chosen at random. Click the cells to toggle their state. When you are ready, click "Start" to begin. You won't be able to toggle the state of cells while generations are progressing.

### "Still Lifes"

When the active cells become stuck in a state which remains static for multiple generations, this is called a "still life". At this point, the game will stop. You may toggle cells and restart if you wish, or refresh the page to begin all over again.

### "Oscillators"

When the active cells become stuck in a state in which they repeatedly alternate between the same two states indefinitely, this is called an "oscillator". Refresh the page to begin again.
